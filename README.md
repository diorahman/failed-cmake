# cmake version is failed

To compile it we need: `webkitgtk-4.0, gtk+-3.0`

The cmake version fails at runtime with following message:

```
Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
```

While the plain `Makefile` version runs just fine.

Please help! :)
